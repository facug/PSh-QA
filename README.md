# PSh-QA
Test for PSH QA Automation

# How to run
clone the repository locally, and install all npm packages with

``` npm i ```

Afterwards you can easily run the tests with:

``` npm run cy:run ```

or, if you want to use the3 cypress dashboard, you can run:

``` npm run cy:open ```

which will open the cypress dashboard, allowing you to click on the spec you want to run (there's only one, named: ``` qaAutomationExam.spec ```)
